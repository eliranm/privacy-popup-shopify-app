# 🚀 Create GitHub Repository - Step by Step Guide

Since I can't directly create the GitHub repository for you, here's exactly what you need to do:

## Method 1: Quick Web Interface (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to GitHub
1. Open [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `privacy-popup-shopify-app`
3. Description: `A production-ready Shopify app that adds customizable privacy popups to storefronts with subscription billing and admin interface`
4. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** choose a license (we can add one later)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/privacy-popup-shopify-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you can install it)

If you can resolve the Xcode license issue, run:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
./setup-github.sh
```

## What You'll Get

Once the repository is created and code is pushed, you'll have:

✅ **Complete Shopify App** with 57 files and 9,380+ lines of code
✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD** that will automatically run on every push
✅ **Professional README** with complete setup instructions
✅ **Issue and PR templates** for community contributions
